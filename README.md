# MNIST_Handwriting_Recognition
## Overview

Welcome to the Handwriting Recognition System project! In this project, I've developed a system that uses the MNIST dataset to perform handwriting recognition on digits from 0 to 9. I've employed the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to achieve accurate recognition with an accuracy, recall, and precision score above 94%.

## Features

- Utilizes the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
- Implements the Random Forest Classifier algorithm for recognition.
- Explores the effects of hyperparameter tuning by playing with the number of estimators (n_estimators) parameter of the Random Forest Classifier algorithm.
- Achieves accuracy, recall, and precision scores above 94%.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 handwritten digits and a test set of 10,000 digits. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image representing a digit from 0 to 9.

## Algorithm and Evaluation

I've employed the Random Forest Classifier algorithm for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and provide accurate classification. The system has been evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision scores, all of which exceed 94%.
